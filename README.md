### Basic tricks in the pattern

## How to approch???...

- 1. Run the outer for loop(rows) for the number of time we are having the lines in the pattern
  2. No.of lines = no.rows = no.of times the outer loop will run
  3. Identify for every row number how many columns are there (or) types of elements in the column(Eg: "*", 1)
  4. What do You need to Print

  ### Example
  - * * * * *
  - * * * * *
  - * * * * *
  - * * * * *
  - * * * * *
 
  - No.of rowns = 5
  - No.of columbs = 5
  - Run outer lopp for 5 time and inner loop for same 5 number of time
